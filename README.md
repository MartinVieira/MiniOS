# MiniOS

The shell repeatedly prints a prompt on the command line, waits for the user to enter commands and executes programs.
This includes supporting both input and output redirection in the same command i.e. sort < f1.txt > f2.txt. This includes multiple pipes within the same command: cat f1.txt | sort.
